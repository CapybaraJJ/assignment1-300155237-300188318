Design 2: Average runtime: ~380's ms High 396ms  Low 368
Design 3: Average runtime: ~4950's ms for P, high 4987ms Low 4889ms. ~ 50's for C high 77 low 47



Design 1:  (PointCP2)

Design 1 advantages: 
Simple to write; 
Polar coordinates are probably more useful than cartesian when studying dynamic movements especially related to the human body

Disadvantages: 
Very specific and does not have many features--not very efficient


Design 2: (PointCP3) Advantages:
Simple to write
Simple calculation 
not much memory usage
fast

Disadvantages:
limited functionality

Design 3: (PointCP5) advantages:
More agile
simplifies the original DesignCP program into easier to maintain modules

Disadvantages:
More memory consumption
